I. Dataset_process.py:
    1. Convert miniseed files to SAC files
    2. Add station info and event info

II. Event_selection.py:
    1. Select eventpairs (master and its egfs), save to "eventpairs.pkl"
    2. Compute signal-to-noise ratio of each stations for events, save to "stationdic_S.pkl" for S wave and to "stationdic_P.pkl" for P wave.
    3. Find common stations for each eventpair, save to "eventpairs_with_stations_S.pkl" for S wave and to "eventpairs_with_stations_P.pkl" for P wave.

III. Spectral_ratio.py
    1. Compute spectral ratio for each common station for a eventpair, save to "eventpairs_with_spectralratio_S.pkl" for S wave and to "eventpairs_with_spectralratio_P.pkl" for P wave.

IV. corner_frequency.py
    1. Select common stations according to the signal-to-noise ratio and the stantion-event distance criteria, and compute the average spectral ratio
    2. Select egf according to the station number and the bootstrapping standard deviation criteria, fit to the Brune source model. Save to "S_separateegf.csv" for S wave and to "P_separateegf.csv" for P wave
    3. Compute the average corner frequency based on selected egfs. Save to "S_uniqmaster.csv" for S wave and to "P_uniqmaster.csv" for P wave.
